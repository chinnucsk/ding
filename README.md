An attempt at writing an IRC bot for the polyglot programmer channel I'm in on Freenode.
I hope to get multiple versions of it in different languages one day.

Feel free to comment on the code.

Goal
----

This is meant to be a learning experience. Building something I enjoy in as much languages as I can.
Hopefully this can be useful for other people too.

Notes
-----
* You need Erlang R15 for the Erlang version to work.
* Don't worry, I'll make it fully OTP soon.

Suggestions I get on IRC
------------------------
klaar:  Gertm: there's also no reason for lists:foreach                                                 
klaar: also use gen_server or gen_fsm :)                                                                 
klaar: also use eunit :P                                                                             
klaar: Gertm: just make sure to do everything in lyse at some point as you go along :)
