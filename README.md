An attempt at writing an IRC bot for the polyglot programmer channel I'm in on Freenode.
I hope to get multiple versions of it in different languages one day.

Feel free to comment on the code.

Goal
----

This is meant to be a learning experience. Building something I enjoy in as much languages as I can.
Hopefully this can be useful for other people too.

Notes
-----
* You need Erlang R15 for the Erlang version to work.
* Don't worry, I'll make it fully OTP soon.
